    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling cognitive processes using both behavioral and neural data requires integrative neurocognitive models that jointly describe decision-making processes and neural dynamics. Traditional approaches, such as sequential sampling models (SSMs) like drift-diffusion models (DDMs), have successfully linked behavioral responses with underlying cognitive parameters. However, extending these models to simultaneously account for neural signals, such as EEG-derived event-related potentials (ERPs), presents significant challenges [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "A key limitation of standard Bayesian inference methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is their computational inefficiency when applied to single-trial data, where each trial introduces new latent variables and dependencies between neural and behavioral measures. This complexity makes traditional likelihood-based inference impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI), as implemented in `BayesFlow` provides an efficient alternative by leveraging deep learning to approximate posterior distributions across many possible model configurations. By training on simulated data, our networks quickly learn to map observed EEG and behavioral measures directly to posterior distributions of cognitive parameters, avoiding the need for case-by-case inference. This approach not only accelerates parameter estimation but also enables robust model validation and generalization across datasets.\n",
