BayesFlow is a Python library for simulation-based **Amortized Bayesian Inference** with neural networks.
It provides users and researchers with:

- A user-friendly API for rapid Bayesian workflows
- A rich collection of neural network architectures
- Multi-backend support via [Keras3](https://keras.io/keras_3/): You can use [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), or [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)

BayesFlow (version 2+) is designed to be a flexible and efficient tool that enables rapid statistical inference
fueled by continuous progress in generative AI and Bayesian inference.

A cornerstone idea of amortized Bayesian inference is to employ generative
neural networks for parameter estimation, model comparison, and model validation
when working with intractable simulators whose behavior as a whole is too
complex to be described analytically.

## Getting Started

Using the high-level interface is easy, as demonstrated by the minimal working example below:

```python
import bayesflow as bf

workflow = bf.BasicWorkflow(
    inference_network=bf.networks.FlowMatching(),
    summary_network=bf.networks.TimeSeriesTransformer(),
    inference_variables=["parameters"],
    summary_variables=["observables"],
    simulator=bf.simulators.SIR()
)

history = workflow.fit_online(epochs=50, batch_size=32, num_batches_per_epoch=500)

diagnostics = workflow.plot_default_diagnostics(test_data=300)
```

## Install

### Backend

First, install one machine learning backend of choice. Note that BayesFlow **will not run** without a backend.

- [Install JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

If you don't know which backend to use, we recommend JAX as it is currently
the fastest backend.

Once installed, [set the backend environment variable as required by keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/#configuring-your-backend). For example, inside your Python script write:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"
import bayesflow
```

If you use conda, you can alternatively set this individually for each environment in your terminal. For example:

```bash
conda env config vars set KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

This way, you also don't have to manually set the backend every time you are starting Python to use BayesFlow.

**Caution:** Some people report that the IDE (e.g., VSCode or PyCharm) can silently overwrite environment variables. If you have set your backend as an environment variable and you still get keras-related import errors when loading BayesFlow, these IDE shenanigans might be the culprit. Try setting the keras backend in your Python script via `import os; os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "<YOUR-BACKEND>"`.

### Using pip

You can install the Bayesflow from Github with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bayesflow-org/bayesflow@main
```

### Using Conda

Bayesflow is currently not conda-installable.

### From Source

If you want to contribute to BayesFlow, we recommend installing it from source:

```bash
git clone -b main git@github.com:bayesflow-org/bayesflow.git
cd <local-path-to-bayesflow-repository>
conda env create --file environment.yaml --name bayesflow
```

Documentation is available at https://bayesflow.org. Please use the [BayesFlow Forums](https://discuss.bayesflow.org/) for any BayesFlow-related questions and discussions, and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bayesflow-org/bayesflow/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

## Citing BayesFlow

You can cite BayesFlow along the lines of:

- We approximated the posterior using neural posterior estimation (NPE) with learned summary statistics (Radev et al., 2020), as implemented in the BayesFlow framework for amortized Bayesian inference (Radev et al., 2023a).
- We approximated the likelihood using neural likelihood estimation (NLE) without hand-crafted summary statistics (Papamakarios et al., 2019), leveraging its implementation in BayesFlow for efficient and flexible inference.

## FAQ

- *I am starting with Bayesflow, which backend shall I use?*
**A**: We recommend JAX as it is currently the fastest backend.

- *What is the difference between Bayesflow 2.0+ and previous versions?*
**A**: BayesFlow 2.0+ is a complete rewrite of the library. It shares the same
overall goals with previous versions, but has much better modularity
and extensibility. What is more, the new BayesFlow has multi-backend support via Keras3,
while the old version was based on TensorFlow.

- *I still need the old BayesFlow for some of my projects. How can I install it?*
**A**: You can find and install the old Bayesflow version via the `stable-legacy` branch on GitHub.
