        This function calculates the log probability density for each sample in `x` under a

        The computation includes the determinant of the covariance matrix, its inverse, and the quadratic

        ----------
        x : Tensor
            A tensor of input samples for which the log probability density is computed.
            The shape should be compatible with broadcasting against `mean`.

            A tensor representing the mean of the multivariate Gaussian distribution.
        covariance : Tensor
            A tensor representing the covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution.
